## About this site/blog ##

This blog is made using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and is hosted in [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). I write every post using the awesome [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor and [Markdown markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I'm using [Git](http://git-scm.com) for version control and the great [magit mode](http://zagadka.vm.bytemark.co.uk/magit/).

The CSS theme is stolen from [Tom Ward's blog](http://tomafro.net) with his permission.
